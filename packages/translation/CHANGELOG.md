# @repo/translation

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6907d18: Refresh Notes with a responsive list and editor, full Organization-scoped title/body search, pagination, explicit saving, protected per-note drafts, and clearer checklist feedback. Preserve newer edits during saves and prevent accidental draft loss during navigation and Organization changes.
- db46fcf: Refresh Todos with inline creation, searchable status views, pagination, protected drafts, and clearer action and attachment feedback. Keep text edits separate from completion changes across web and mobile, and preserve Organization scoping.
- 4143c11: Refresh the AI Assistant with a responsive conversation workspace, a growing keyboard-accessible composer, per-conversation drafts, and readable Todo and Note results. Keep replies attached to their originating conversation during navigation and preserve prompts after failures.

### Patch Changes

- 99a5fc9: Redesign existing client workflows with neutral light and dark themes, consistent motion, responsive navigation, and clearer form feedback. Preserve drafts during preference changes and failed submissions.

  Reset route state when the Active Organization changes, prevent pending forms from being edited or dismissed, and improve checklist and Attachment controls. Keep collapsed sidebar preferences contained and long menus scrollable.

- 28ab725: Add consistent entry and exit motion to drawers, dialogs, menus, tooltips, and Attachment disclosures. Smooth sidebar collapse and preference placement, preserve upload and form state, and respect device reduced motion. Share generated motion easing and distances with native controls and keep interrupted native dialog exits safe.

  Add stable, labeled Language and Theme footer rows with current values, native language names, and accessible radio menus. Keep their vertical positions fixed during collapse and preserve menu focus, drafts, and saved preferences.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- cd623ee: Describe the dashboard Flow card in Organization language instead of team wording across the `en`, `de`, and `sr` locales.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 22a7c4d: Close a batch of principal architecture review findings: honest package `dev` scripts, stronger catalog enforcement, fuller `create:package` wiring, Vitest UI/`test:watch`, digest-pinned Docker bases with a blocking Trivy CRITICAL gate, and CI/DX hardening (knip/boundaries on PRs, safer concurrency, caches, launch configs).
- 7bdc15c: Add dead-code and dependency-graph enforcement, and finish declaring the graph.

  `pnpm knip` and `pnpm boundaries` are new and both run in `pnpm check`. `turbo boundaries` complements the existing ESLint rules rather than replacing them: it catches importing a package a workspace does not declare, which ESLint cannot see, while ESLint keeps enforcing the web/mobile UI split and the `@repo/*/src` deep-import ban. `boundaries` is experimental in Turbo 2.8, which is why it is additive.

  `turbo boundaries` found 153 undeclared imports: 145 test files importing `vitest`, and `packages/config/eslint/*.js` importing six ESLint plugins. All resolved only through pnpm root hoisting. Every workspace that imports `vitest` now declares it, and the six plugins moved from the root to `@repo/config`, which is where they are imported — the root `eslint.config.mjs` only re-exports. `pnpm --filter <workspace> test` no longer depends on hoisting. One exception remains, marked with `@boundaries-ignore`: `packages/config/mobile-lan-dev.test.ts` reaches into `tooling/dev-mobile-lan.ts`, a loose root script with no workspace of its own to be tested from.

  knip is configured against this repo's conventions rather than run on defaults, which reported 63 false "unused files". Test files are entry points; the vitest `react-native` alias target, Expo/Metro config, and template placeholder files are ignored; the `exports` and `types` rules are off because this repo deliberately exports internals for unit testing. The dependency rule keeps an explicit ignore list for things static analysis cannot see: `pino-pretty` (referenced as a transport string), `tailwindcss` (a Tailwind v4 peer of `@tailwindcss/vite`), the `catalog:mobile` React Native singleton pins, Expo plugin inferences, and `zod` in `@repo/auth`.

  That last one is worth recording: knip reported `zod` as unused in `@repo/auth` and nothing imports it, but removing it breaks the build with TS2742 — better-auth's inferred types reference zod, so it is required for declaration emit. The pre-existing catalog alignment test already guarded it. **Verify a dependency removal with a build, not a grep.**

  Removed genuinely dead code that knip surfaced, each verified unreferenced first: eight source files across api/web/mobile, plus `react-i18next` from `@repo/translation` (declared but imported nowhere in the repo). Deleted `vitest.workspace.ts` — it used `defineWorkspace`, deprecated in the installed Vitest 3.2.4 and removed in 4, was invoked by nothing, and had drifted from `vitest.coverage.config.ts`, which is now the single project list.

  Normalized the four tsconfigs that extended the root base directly instead of the shared presets in `packages/config/typescript/`.

  Five new alignment tests, each verified to fail when violated: every workspace declares `@repo/config`; `globalDependencies` never lists the lockfile or globs a package; neither Dockerfile hand-copies `packages/config`; vitest importers declare vitest; ESLint plugins live in `@repo/config` and not the root.

- fdce5d8: Template audit follow-through fixes:
  - `@repo/api`: batch `Todo.attachments` and `Note.todos` through per-request DataLoaders, surface attachment lookup failures instead of returning `[]`, and reject `createTodo` inputs whose `noteId` belongs to another organization.
  - `@repo/db`: add organization-scoped indexes on `todos`, `notes`, and `files` (migration `0008`).
  - `@repo/config`: enforce `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` as an error.
  - `@repo/translation`: locale-consistency test now discovers namespaces from disk, covering `assistant`, `notes`, and `storage`.

- 79fa89e: Complete TypeScript project references for tsc-emitting packages: composite `tsconfig.build.json` + `tsc -b`, while typecheck keeps source paths (issue #147).
- 21b3002: Make the Turbo dependency graph honest and stop the cache from invalidating itself.

  `@repo/config` was consumed by every workspace through relative `tsconfig` extends and the root ESLint/Prettier configs, but was declared as a dependency by nobody. Three workarounds had grown around that missing edge: a `packages/config/**` entry in `globalDependencies`, a hand-written `COPY --from=pruner /app/packages/config/` in both Dockerfiles because `turbo prune` correctly excluded it, and a hardcoded `SHARED_BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRS` in `.ai/release.util.ts`. Every workspace now declares `@repo/config`, and all three workarounds are gone — `turbo prune` includes the presets on its own, and `release-apps` derives affected apps from the graph.

  Cache inputs are now scoped to what each task actually reads. Global hashed files drop from 27 to 2:
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` left `globalDependencies` — Turborepo already hashes each package's resolved external dependencies, so listing the whole lockfile invalidated every task in every package on any dependency bump.
  - `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierrc*` moved from `globalDependencies` to per-task `inputs` on `lint` and `format:check` via `$TURBO_ROOT$`, so a lint-config edit no longer invalidates `build` and `test`.
  - Globbing `packages/config/**` had pulled gitignored `.turbo/*.log` files, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the package's own tests into the global hash. A new `packages/config/turbo.json` narrows its `build` inputs to the preset files.
  - `build` now excludes `CHANGELOG.md`, so `changeset version` no longer busts every build cache.
  - `CI` moved from `globalEnv` to `globalPassThroughEnv`. It is unset locally and `true` in Actions, so hashing it meant a CI cache entry could never be restored on a developer machine, or the reverse.

  Three alignment tests guard the fix: every workspace must declare `@repo/config`, `globalDependencies` must not glob a package or list the lockfile, and neither Dockerfile may hand-copy `packages/config`.

  `test` keeps its `^build` dependency. Wiping every `dist` and running tests without building fails `@repo/email#test`, because only `apps/api`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/auth`, and `packages/mobile-ui` alias `@repo/*` to source in their vitest config; the rest resolve siblings through package exports. That is now recorded in the task description.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 87e6d0b: Add a Notes feature and multi-chat assistant. Notes have a title, a body, and a
  checklist of todos (todos gain a nullable `note_id`, detached on note delete). Notes are
  managed at `/notes` + `/notes/:id` and can also be created/updated by the AI assistant
  via new tools (`createNote` with an inline checklist, `listNotes`, `updateNote`,
  `addTodoToNote`); note changes stream live over `note:*` subscriptions. The assistant page
  becomes multi-chat: conversations are listed, resumable, and deletable, message history
  loads on open, and each assistant turn surfaces clickable links to the notes it created.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f136b60: Add an agentic AI assistant example that extends the todo generator. A new `/assistant`
  chat runs a multi-step tool-calling loop (Vercel AI SDK `streamText` + `stepCountIs`) that
  can create, list, complete, update, and delete todos through org-scoped tools. Replies stream
  token-by-token over a new `assistantMessageDelta` subscription, and the assistant page shows a
  live todo list driven by the existing `todo:*` events. Conversations and messages are persisted
  in new `assistant_conversations` and `assistant_messages` tables. The assistant provider config
  falls back to the existing `AI_TODO_PROVIDER`/`AI_TODO_MODEL` (OpenAI/DeepSeek) settings.
