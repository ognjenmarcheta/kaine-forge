# @repo/translation

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5786f03: Intake drafts grade the issue's fit for an agent run: clarity, complexity, and verifiability from 1 to 3, with the lowest grade as the confidence. `desk draft` and the draft dialog show the grades, and `desk start` warns, without blocking, when the scored body has confidence 1.
- 078f259: Send PR feedback back to the builder after ship. At `pr-open`, `pnpm desk feedback <n> --from-pr [text]` (and the `pr-feedback` action, **Send PR feedback** in the UI) reads the failing checks with their log tail and the reviews and comments of trusted accounts on the PR head, redacts, cuts, and fences that text, adds the owner's optional note, and runs build, check, and review again. It refuses with `pr-refused` and changes nothing unless the PR is open, its head is the clean worktree HEAD, and there is something to send. The ship of such a round updates the open PR: no rebase, a plain push to the same branch, no new PR, and a fresh read of the PR right before the push.
- 078f259: Add a `pr-open` stage after `ship`. The desk waits there while the owner reviews and merges the draft PR on GitHub. `pnpm desk refresh <n>` (and the `refresh-pr` action, **Check the PR** in the UI) reads the PR once: merged ends the issue at `shipped`, closed ends it at `cancelled`, open changes nothing. The desk does not poll, and it never merges, approves, marks a PR ready, enables auto-merge, or force-pushes. The issue state counts PR feedback rounds against the new `maxPrRounds` config (default 3).

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- cb7174c: Add the `@repo/desk` workspace: the shared stage and agent-output contracts, the pure pipeline
  transition table, the per-issue state store with a process lease, and the desk configuration
  loader for the upcoming local agent desk. Add the GitHub intake path: the `gh` port, owner
  authorization, the issue contract reader, `agent:*` execution labels, the status comment, the
  worktree bootstrap plan, `desk doctor`, and the `start`, `status`, and `labels sync` commands.
  Add the pipeline engine: the stage runner with engine invariants around every agent run, the
  scheduler, process leases, and restart recovery.
  Add the engine commands (`approve`, `feedback`, `continue`, `cancel`, `remove`, `logs`, `resume`), live progress, a persistent redacted agent log, and a `notifyCommand` that runs without a shell.
  Add the ship step: `ship --dry-run` and `ship --confirm` commit, push, and open a draft PR through the repository hooks after a fail-closed gate (confirmation, matching checks and review, owner identity, authorization, refs baseline). The desk never merges. Add the local server (`desk serve`) with a loopback-only, cookie-protected API.
  Add the `@repo/desk-ui` workspace: the React desk with a board, an issue page, a React Flow graph of the pipeline, the plan and ship gates with a two-step ship dialog, a live log, and a health view, in English, German, and Serbian. Add the `desk` translation namespace. `pnpm desk serve` builds the UI first when it is missing, and `pnpm desk:ui` starts the Vite dev server with a proxy to a running desk. `@repo/desk` adds the `ship-plan` artifact id and browser-safe views of the check report and the ship plan.
  The built desk opens at a plain local URL in each browser and issues its session cookie on page load. The one-use link remains for the separate Vite development origin.
  Add optional Docker isolation (`desk start --isolation docker`, `isolation: "docker"`). One `IsolationPort` decides where the builder and the check steps run. In Docker mode they run in hardened containers with no network, a read-only root, no capabilities, and no host mount. Work moves in as a git bundle and a patch and out as a guarded patch, and dependencies come through a registry-only proxy and install offline. Add `desk docker build|login|doctor|status|prune`, `desk doctor --probe` with isolation probes, a per-issue `isolation` state field, a `docker` config block, labelled and verified cleanup in `remove` and crash recovery, and a container-only Codex sandbox flag. Real-Docker tests run with `DESK_DOCKER=1`.
  The desk board is a kanban with search, a start dialog, toasts, and compact cards that read only the issue summary (`prUrl`, `contract`, `stageEnteredAt`, `resumeStage`, `progress`, `currentNode`). Log entries carry their time in `at` only. `@repo/ui` also exports the `GitPullRequest`, `Plus`, `Search`, `SlidersHorizontal`, and `X` icons.
  The engine stops an agent run that repeats the same failing tool call 8 times and sends the issue to `needs-you`. Every agent run appends a record to `runs.jsonl` in the state root, and `desk stats` compares the runs by role, provider, and model. `GET /api/stats` serves the same numbers, the issue detail carries its `runs`, and the desk UI adds a **Runs** view and agent-usage tiles in the inspector. Token counts mean the same for Claude and Codex. A failed health check shows the command that repairs it, and the Health page can build the Docker image after a confirmation (`POST /api/health/fix`). `desk serve` reports the Docker checks too. On Windows the engine starts `pnpm` through `npm_execpath` and keeps the profile variables, so `pnpm` and the `gh` login work there. The Start dialog lists the open issues of the repository to pick from (ready label, contract count, already on the board), and the board shows the open pull requests read-only (`GET /api/github`). `desk contract` shows how intake reads an issue body, the issue templates follow the shared issue format, an issue that stops at intake keeps its title, and the UI offers Start again for it instead of a Continue that intake refuses. `desk draft` has the read-only intake agent draft a stopped issue in the issue format; the engine renders the body and keeps the old text as a quote. `desk draft --apply` writes the draft to the issue after an explicit yes, as the owner, and only when the issue did not change since the draft. The issue page offers Draft the issue format, a review dialog with the proposal and the open questions, and Apply with a second confirmation (actions `draft` and `apply-draft`, artifact `issue-draft`).
  Each run record now names the harness the agent started with (`harness: { repo, desk, head }`), and `desk stats --by-harness` splits the rows by instruction version. The desk writes review findings, failed checks, stuck runs, denials, verification violations, and broken invariants to `lessons.jsonl`, which `remove` keeps. `desk lessons` and `GET /api/lessons` list the problems seen in two or more issues, and the **Runs** view shows them as lesson candidates. The harness-eval ledger accepts calibrations and protocol 2 runs, whose conclusion must agree with the measured noise floor.

## 1.4.1

- b39e2d4: Add the optional local factory dashboard with run history, evidence, health checks,
  and supervised controls. Include English, Serbian, and German interface strings.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6907d18: Refresh Notes with a responsive list and editor, full Organization-scoped title/body search, pagination, explicit saving, protected per-note drafts, and clearer checklist feedback. Preserve newer edits during saves and prevent accidental draft loss during navigation and Organization changes.
- db46fcf: Refresh Todos with inline creation, searchable status views, pagination, protected drafts, and clearer action and attachment feedback. Keep text edits separate from completion changes across web and mobile, and preserve Organization scoping.
- 4143c11: Refresh the AI Assistant with a responsive conversation workspace, a growing keyboard-accessible composer, per-conversation drafts, and readable Todo and Note results. Keep replies attached to their originating conversation during navigation and preserve prompts after failures.

### Patch Changes

- 99a5fc9: Redesign existing client workflows with neutral light and dark themes, consistent motion, responsive navigation, and clearer form feedback. Preserve drafts during preference changes and failed submissions.

  Reset route state when the Active Organization changes, prevent pending forms from being edited or dismissed, and improve checklist and Attachment controls. Keep collapsed sidebar preferences contained and long menus scrollable.

- 28ab725: Add consistent entry and exit motion to drawers, dialogs, menus, tooltips, and Attachment disclosures. Smooth sidebar collapse and preference placement, preserve upload and form state, and respect device reduced motion. Share generated motion easing and distances with native controls and keep interrupted native dialog exits safe.

  Add stable, labeled Language and Theme footer rows with current values, native language names, and accessible radio menus. Keep their vertical positions fixed during collapse and preserve menu focus, drafts, and saved preferences.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- cd623ee: Describe the dashboard Flow card in Organization language instead of team wording across the `en`, `de`, and `sr` locales.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 22a7c4d: Close a batch of principal architecture review findings: honest package `dev` scripts, stronger catalog enforcement, fuller `create:package` wiring, Vitest UI/`test:watch`, digest-pinned Docker bases with a blocking Trivy CRITICAL gate, and CI/DX hardening (knip/boundaries on PRs, safer concurrency, caches, launch configs).
- 7bdc15c: Add dead-code and dependency-graph enforcement, and finish declaring the graph.

  `pnpm knip` and `pnpm boundaries` are new and both run in `pnpm check`. `turbo boundaries` complements the existing ESLint rules rather than replacing them: it catches importing a package a workspace does not declare, which ESLint cannot see, while ESLint keeps enforcing the web/mobile UI split and the `@repo/*/src` deep-import ban. `boundaries` is experimental in Turbo 2.8, which is why it is additive.

  `turbo boundaries` found 153 undeclared imports: 145 test files importing `vitest`, and `packages/config/eslint/*.js` importing six ESLint plugins. All resolved only through pnpm root hoisting. Every workspace that imports `vitest` now declares it, and the six plugins moved from the root to `@repo/config`, which is where they are imported — the root `eslint.config.mjs` only re-exports. `pnpm --filter <workspace> test` no longer depends on hoisting. One exception remains, marked with `@boundaries-ignore`: `packages/config/mobile-lan-dev.test.ts` reaches into `tooling/dev-mobile-lan.ts`, a loose root script with no workspace of its own to be tested from.

  knip is configured against this repo's conventions rather than run on defaults, which reported 63 false "unused files". Test files are entry points; the vitest `react-native` alias target, Expo/Metro config, and template placeholder files are ignored; the `exports` and `types` rules are off because this repo deliberately exports internals for unit testing. The dependency rule keeps an explicit ignore list for things static analysis cannot see: `pino-pretty` (referenced as a transport string), `tailwindcss` (a Tailwind v4 peer of `@tailwindcss/vite`), the `catalog:mobile` React Native singleton pins, Expo plugin inferences, and `zod` in `@repo/auth`.

  That last one is worth recording: knip reported `zod` as unused in `@repo/auth` and nothing imports it, but removing it breaks the build with TS2742 — better-auth's inferred types reference zod, so it is required for declaration emit. The pre-existing catalog alignment test already guarded it. **Verify a dependency removal with a build, not a grep.**

  Removed genuinely dead code that knip surfaced, each verified unreferenced first: eight source files across api/web/mobile, plus `react-i18next` from `@repo/translation` (declared but imported nowhere in the repo). Deleted `vitest.workspace.ts` — it used `defineWorkspace`, deprecated in the installed Vitest 3.2.4 and removed in 4, was invoked by nothing, and had drifted from `vitest.coverage.config.ts`, which is now the single project list.

  Normalized the four tsconfigs that extended the root base directly instead of the shared presets in `packages/config/typescript/`.

  Five new alignment tests, each verified to fail when violated: every workspace declares `@repo/config`; `globalDependencies` never lists the lockfile or globs a package; neither Dockerfile hand-copies `packages/config`; vitest importers declare vitest; ESLint plugins live in `@repo/config` and not the root.

- fdce5d8: Template audit follow-through fixes:
  - `@repo/api`: batch `Todo.attachments` and `Note.todos` through per-request DataLoaders, surface attachment lookup failures instead of returning `[]`, and reject `createTodo` inputs whose `noteId` belongs to another organization.
  - `@repo/db`: add organization-scoped indexes on `todos`, `notes`, and `files` (migration `0008`).
  - `@repo/config`: enforce `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` as an error.
  - `@repo/translation`: locale-consistency test now discovers namespaces from disk, covering `assistant`, `notes`, and `storage`.

- 79fa89e: Complete TypeScript project references for tsc-emitting packages: composite `tsconfig.build.json` + `tsc -b`, while typecheck keeps source paths (issue #147).
- 21b3002: Make the Turbo dependency graph honest and stop the cache from invalidating itself.

  `@repo/config` was consumed by every workspace through relative `tsconfig` extends and the root ESLint/Prettier configs, but was declared as a dependency by nobody. Three workarounds had grown around that missing edge: a `packages/config/**` entry in `globalDependencies`, a hand-written `COPY --from=pruner /app/packages/config/` in both Dockerfiles because `turbo prune` correctly excluded it, and a hardcoded `SHARED_BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRS` in `.ai/release.util.ts`. Every workspace now declares `@repo/config`, and all three workarounds are gone — `turbo prune` includes the presets on its own, and `release-apps` derives affected apps from the graph.

  Cache inputs are now scoped to what each task actually reads. Global hashed files drop from 27 to 2:
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` left `globalDependencies` — Turborepo already hashes each package's resolved external dependencies, so listing the whole lockfile invalidated every task in every package on any dependency bump.
  - `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierrc*` moved from `globalDependencies` to per-task `inputs` on `lint` and `format:check` via `$TURBO_ROOT$`, so a lint-config edit no longer invalidates `build` and `test`.
  - Globbing `packages/config/**` had pulled gitignored `.turbo/*.log` files, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the package's own tests into the global hash. A new `packages/config/turbo.json` narrows its `build` inputs to the preset files.
  - `build` now excludes `CHANGELOG.md`, so `changeset version` no longer busts every build cache.
  - `CI` moved from `globalEnv` to `globalPassThroughEnv`. It is unset locally and `true` in Actions, so hashing it meant a CI cache entry could never be restored on a developer machine, or the reverse.

  Three alignment tests guard the fix: every workspace must declare `@repo/config`, `globalDependencies` must not glob a package or list the lockfile, and neither Dockerfile may hand-copy `packages/config`.

  `test` keeps its `^build` dependency. Wiping every `dist` and running tests without building fails `@repo/email#test`, because only `apps/api`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/auth`, and `packages/mobile-ui` alias `@repo/*` to source in their vitest config; the rest resolve siblings through package exports. That is now recorded in the task description.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 87e6d0b: Add a Notes feature and multi-chat assistant. Notes have a title, a body, and a
  checklist of todos (todos gain a nullable `note_id`, detached on note delete). Notes are
  managed at `/notes` + `/notes/:id` and can also be created/updated by the AI assistant
  via new tools (`createNote` with an inline checklist, `listNotes`, `updateNote`,
  `addTodoToNote`); note changes stream live over `note:*` subscriptions. The assistant page
  becomes multi-chat: conversations are listed, resumable, and deletable, message history
  loads on open, and each assistant turn surfaces clickable links to the notes it created.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f136b60: Add an agentic AI assistant example that extends the todo generator. A new `/assistant`
  chat runs a multi-step tool-calling loop (Vercel AI SDK `streamText` + `stepCountIs`) that
  can create, list, complete, update, and delete todos through org-scoped tools. Replies stream
  token-by-token over a new `assistantMessageDelta` subscription, and the assistant page shows a
  live todo list driven by the existing `todo:*` events. Conversations and messages are persisted
  in new `assistant_conversations` and `assistant_messages` tables. The assistant provider config
  falls back to the existing `AI_TODO_PROVIDER`/`AI_TODO_MODEL` (OpenAI/DeepSeek) settings.
