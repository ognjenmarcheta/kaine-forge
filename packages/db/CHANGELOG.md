# @repo/db

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f884c6b: Add optional email verification on signup (AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION, soft mode): users.email_verified column + migration, hashed verification tokens with atomic claim, emailVerified exposed on the session user payload, and /api/auth/verify-email plus session-authenticated /api/auth/resend-email-verification
- d03004e: Add organization invitation lifecycle: create/list/accept/revoke with role rules, expiry, and email notification. New REST routes under /api/auth/organization/invitation/\* and an invitations GraphQL query. Membership rows are now enforced unique per (organization, user) via a new unique index and migration, and invitation acceptance flips status and inserts the membership atomically. Note: the migration fails if duplicate (organization, user) member rows already exist — dedupe manually before migrating. Migration 0001 also backfills the `files` table and `file_status` enum, which previously existed only in schema source; databases provisioned via `db:push` from an earlier main already have them and must skip those statements when adopting `db:migrate`.

### Patch Changes

- 3733f8d: Replace unsalted SHA-256 password hashing with salted scrypt; legacy hashes still verify and are rehashed on login. Seed data uses the new format.
