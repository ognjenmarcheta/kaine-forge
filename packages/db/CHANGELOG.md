## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 87e6d0b: Add a Notes feature and multi-chat assistant. Notes have a title, a body, and a
  checklist of todos (todos gain a nullable `note_id`, detached on note delete). Notes are
  managed at `/notes` + `/notes/:id` and can also be created/updated by the AI assistant
  via new tools (`createNote` with an inline checklist, `listNotes`, `updateNote`,
  `addTodoToNote`); note changes stream live over `note:*` subscriptions. The assistant page
  becomes multi-chat: conversations are listed, resumable, and deletable, message history
  loads on open, and each assistant turn surfaces clickable links to the notes it created.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f136b60: Add an agentic AI assistant example that extends the todo generator. A new `/assistant`
  chat runs a multi-step tool-calling loop (Vercel AI SDK `streamText` + `stepCountIs`) that
  can create, list, complete, update, and delete todos through org-scoped tools. Replies stream
  token-by-token over a new `assistantMessageDelta` subscription, and the assistant page shows a
  live todo list driven by the existing `todo:*` events. Conversations and messages are persisted
  in new `assistant_conversations` and `assistant_messages` tables. The assistant provider config
  falls back to the existing `AI_TODO_PROVIDER`/`AI_TODO_MODEL` (OpenAI/DeepSeek) settings.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c046f32: Introduce the better-auth instance (drizzle adapter, custom scrypt hooks, organization + bearer plugins) and align the database schema; passwords migrate to credential accounts
- 68ebc61: Serve /api/auth/\* through better-auth's node handler; ServerAuth slims to the session/read facade; signup invariants move to better-auth database hooks. users.password_hash becomes nullable so better-auth-created users need no legacy hash.
- 9cc4adf: Drop the superseded users.password_hash column (credential accounts are authoritative) and polish client member-list/slug-retry edges

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f884c6b: Add optional email verification on signup (AUTH_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION, soft mode): users.email_verified column + migration, hashed verification tokens with atomic claim, emailVerified exposed on the session user payload, and /api/auth/verify-email plus session-authenticated /api/auth/resend-email-verification
- d03004e: Add organization invitation lifecycle: create/list/accept/revoke with role rules, expiry, and email notification. New REST routes under /api/auth/organization/invitation/\* and an invitations GraphQL query. Membership rows are now enforced unique per (organization, user) via a new unique index and migration, and invitation acceptance flips status and inserts the membership atomically. Note: the migration fails if duplicate (organization, user) member rows already exist — dedupe manually before migrating. Migration 0001 also backfills the `files` table and `file_status` enum, which previously existed only in schema source; databases provisioned via `db:push` from an earlier main already have them and must skip those statements when adopting `db:migrate`.

### Patch Changes

- 3733f8d: Replace unsalted SHA-256 password hashing with salted scrypt; legacy hashes still verify and are rehashed on login. Seed data uses the new format.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- efcb73a: Backport template-safe runtime hardening, Docker support, bearer auth fallback, organization members wiring, mobile UI primitives, and generated AI assistant scaffold.
