# @repo/ui

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 527509e: Follow the Byteforge website's new red-orange accent. Brand and selected fills are `#d4421a` in both themes, and text on them is white through `--ds-text-brand-inverse`. Hovered and pressed fills get darker so white text stays WCAG AA. Links, brand text, selected tints, focus rings, and brand borders and icons move to matching values. Select action items now use `--ds-text-brand` instead of the fill color, so they stay readable on the dark overlay.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f69756: Redesign the agent desk around the owner's turn. The board opens on Your turn with quick and batch approve for low-risk plans, the issue page has a short header, decision gates with plan risk and file review, a trace of every step, and a stage side sheet, and the shell adds a command palette, shortcuts, an 8-second undo window, and opt-in notifications. Health shows setup progress, Runs adds today's summary, seven-day cards, and cost by role, and lessons can be promoted, unpromoted, or turned into a GitHub issue after the owner confirms the exact text. The engine records plan risk, pause and resume, approve notes, and a seven-day series, and the design system adds the tokens the desk uses.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3408a45: Adopt the Byteforge brand as the default light and dark themes. The palette uses one orange for actions, selection, links, and focus, on cool white and ink-black neutrals, with matching success, information, warning, and danger roles and a darker amber severe role. Text on orange fills uses the new `--ds-text-brand-inverse` token so it meets WCAG AA, and a contrast contract test checks the key pairs in both themes. Web, desktop, and mobile use Geist and Geist Mono, self-hosted. Shapes follow the site: pill buttons, 8px inputs, 12px menus, and 20px cards and dialogs. Shadows are ink-tinted, the easing is a quick ease-out, and buttons scale to `--ds-motion-press-scale` (0.97) on press. This replaces `--ds-motion-distance-press`, and `@repo/mobile-ui` exports `motionPressScale` and `fontFamilies` and drops `motionDistances.press`. A new mark, an olive tree growing through the Byteforge anvil, replaces the app icons, favicon, and README logo, and its Blender source and render script are in `media/brand/`.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e047bf0: Name the organization switcher, user menu, and compact/full shell select triggers by their visible text (WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name). Removes the unused `ariaLabel` prop from `OrganizationSwitcher` and `NavUser`; `ShellSelectControl` applies `ariaLabel` only to its icon-only trigger.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- cb7174c: Add the `@repo/desk` workspace: the shared stage and agent-output contracts, the pure pipeline
  transition table, the per-issue state store with a process lease, and the desk configuration
  loader for the upcoming local agent desk. Add the GitHub intake path: the `gh` port, owner
  authorization, the issue contract reader, `agent:*` execution labels, the status comment, the
  worktree bootstrap plan, `desk doctor`, and the `start`, `status`, and `labels sync` commands.
  Add the pipeline engine: the stage runner with engine invariants around every agent run, the
  scheduler, process leases, and restart recovery.
  Add the engine commands (`approve`, `feedback`, `continue`, `cancel`, `remove`, `logs`, `resume`), live progress, a persistent redacted agent log, and a `notifyCommand` that runs without a shell.
  Add the ship step: `ship --dry-run` and `ship --confirm` commit, push, and open a draft PR through the repository hooks after a fail-closed gate (confirmation, matching checks and review, owner identity, authorization, refs baseline). The desk never merges. Add the local server (`desk serve`) with a loopback-only, cookie-protected API.
  Add the `@repo/desk-ui` workspace: the React desk with a board, an issue page, a React Flow graph of the pipeline, the plan and ship gates with a two-step ship dialog, a live log, and a health view, in English, German, and Serbian. Add the `desk` translation namespace. `pnpm desk serve` builds the UI first when it is missing, and `pnpm desk:ui` starts the Vite dev server with a proxy to a running desk. `@repo/desk` adds the `ship-plan` artifact id and browser-safe views of the check report and the ship plan.
  The built desk opens at a plain local URL in each browser and issues its session cookie on page load. The one-use link remains for the separate Vite development origin.
  Add optional Docker isolation (`desk start --isolation docker`, `isolation: "docker"`). One `IsolationPort` decides where the builder and the check steps run. In Docker mode they run in hardened containers with no network, a read-only root, no capabilities, and no host mount. Work moves in as a git bundle and a patch and out as a guarded patch, and dependencies come through a registry-only proxy and install offline. Add `desk docker build|login|doctor|status|prune`, `desk doctor --probe` with isolation probes, a per-issue `isolation` state field, a `docker` config block, labelled and verified cleanup in `remove` and crash recovery, and a container-only Codex sandbox flag. Real-Docker tests run with `DESK_DOCKER=1`.
  The desk board is a kanban with search, a start dialog, toasts, and compact cards that read only the issue summary (`prUrl`, `contract`, `stageEnteredAt`, `resumeStage`, `progress`, `currentNode`). Log entries carry their time in `at` only. `@repo/ui` also exports the `GitPullRequest`, `Plus`, `Search`, `SlidersHorizontal`, and `X` icons.
  The engine stops an agent run that repeats the same failing tool call 8 times and sends the issue to `needs-you`. Every agent run appends a record to `runs.jsonl` in the state root, and `desk stats` compares the runs by role, provider, and model. `GET /api/stats` serves the same numbers, the issue detail carries its `runs`, and the desk UI adds a **Runs** view and agent-usage tiles in the inspector. Token counts mean the same for Claude and Codex. A failed health check shows the command that repairs it, and the Health page can build the Docker image after a confirmation (`POST /api/health/fix`). `desk serve` reports the Docker checks too. On Windows the engine starts `pnpm` through `npm_execpath` and keeps the profile variables, so `pnpm` and the `gh` login work there. The Start dialog lists the open issues of the repository to pick from (ready label, contract count, already on the board), and the board shows the open pull requests read-only (`GET /api/github`). `desk contract` shows how intake reads an issue body, the issue templates follow the shared issue format, an issue that stops at intake keeps its title, and the UI offers Start again for it instead of a Continue that intake refuses. `desk draft` has the read-only intake agent draft a stopped issue in the issue format; the engine renders the body and keeps the old text as a quote. `desk draft --apply` writes the draft to the issue after an explicit yes, as the owner, and only when the issue did not change since the draft. The issue page offers Draft the issue format, a review dialog with the proposal and the open questions, and Apply with a second confirmation (actions `draft` and `apply-draft`, artifact `issue-draft`).
  Each run record now names the harness the agent started with (`harness: { repo, desk, head }`), and `desk stats --by-harness` splits the rows by instruction version. The desk writes review findings, failed checks, stuck runs, denials, verification violations, and broken invariants to `lessons.jsonl`, which `remove` keeps. `desk lessons` and `GET /api/lessons` list the problems seen in two or more issues, and the **Runs** view shows them as lesson candidates. The harness-eval ledger accepts calibrations and protocol 2 runs, whose conclusion must agree with the measured noise floor.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 99a5fc9: Redesign existing client workflows with neutral light and dark themes, consistent motion, responsive navigation, and clearer form feedback. Preserve drafts during preference changes and failed submissions.

  Reset route state when the Active Organization changes, prevent pending forms from being edited or dismissed, and improve checklist and Attachment controls. Keep collapsed sidebar preferences contained and long menus scrollable.

- 28ab725: Add consistent entry and exit motion to drawers, dialogs, menus, tooltips, and Attachment disclosures. Smooth sidebar collapse and preference placement, preserve upload and form state, and respect device reduced motion. Share generated motion easing and distances with native controls and keep interrupted native dialog exits safe.

  Add stable, labeled Language and Theme footer rows with current values, native language names, and accessible radio menus. Keep their vertical positions fixed during collapse and preserve menu focus, drafts, and saved preferences.

- 6907d18: Refresh Notes with a responsive list and editor, full Organization-scoped title/body search, pagination, explicit saving, protected per-note drafts, and clearer checklist feedback. Preserve newer edits during saves and prevent accidental draft loss during navigation and Organization changes.
- db46fcf: Refresh Todos with inline creation, searchable status views, pagination, protected drafts, and clearer action and attachment feedback. Keep text edits separate from completion changes across web and mobile, and preserve Organization scoping.
- 4143c11: Refresh the AI Assistant with a responsive conversation workspace, a growing keyboard-accessible composer, per-conversation drafts, and readable Todo and Note results. Keep replies attached to their originating conversation during navigation and preserve prompts after failures.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- ceef03e: Intentional dependency upgrades from issue #198: Dependabot freezes for mobile singleton packages, jsdom 30, web React 19.2 catalog, GraphQL Codegen v7 suite with client regenerate, and Expo SDK 55 mobile graph (RN 0.83, expo ~55).
- 14601b7: Use a single `radix-ui` entrypoint (drop dual `@radix-ui/*` pins) and bump to 1.6.7 for root-import type and primitive fixes.
- fc1395e: Upgrade web tooling to Vite 8 (Rolldown-powered build, lightningcss minification). Replace the invalid `var()` media query in `globals.css` with its literal breakpoint value: media queries cannot consume custom properties, so the sub-768px layout block previously never matched in any browser and now applies as intended. Closes the vite workstream from the 2026-08 security triage.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a6e25d: Rename TeamSwitcher public API to OrganizationSwitcher to match CONTEXT domain language.

### Patch Changes

- 22a7c4d: Close a batch of principal architecture review findings: honest package `dev` scripts, stronger catalog enforcement, fuller `create:package` wiring, Vitest UI/`test:watch`, digest-pinned Docker bases with a blocking Trivy CRITICAL gate, and CI/DX hardening (knip/boundaries on PRs, safer concurrency, caches, launch configs).
- 7bdc15c: Add dead-code and dependency-graph enforcement, and finish declaring the graph.

  `pnpm knip` and `pnpm boundaries` are new and both run in `pnpm check`. `turbo boundaries` complements the existing ESLint rules rather than replacing them: it catches importing a package a workspace does not declare, which ESLint cannot see, while ESLint keeps enforcing the web/mobile UI split and the `@repo/*/src` deep-import ban. `boundaries` is experimental in Turbo 2.8, which is why it is additive.

  `turbo boundaries` found 153 undeclared imports: 145 test files importing `vitest`, and `packages/config/eslint/*.js` importing six ESLint plugins. All resolved only through pnpm root hoisting. Every workspace that imports `vitest` now declares it, and the six plugins moved from the root to `@repo/config`, which is where they are imported — the root `eslint.config.mjs` only re-exports. `pnpm --filter <workspace> test` no longer depends on hoisting. One exception remains, marked with `@boundaries-ignore`: `packages/config/mobile-lan-dev.test.ts` reaches into `tooling/dev-mobile-lan.ts`, a loose root script with no workspace of its own to be tested from.

  knip is configured against this repo's conventions rather than run on defaults, which reported 63 false "unused files". Test files are entry points; the vitest `react-native` alias target, Expo/Metro config, and template placeholder files are ignored; the `exports` and `types` rules are off because this repo deliberately exports internals for unit testing. The dependency rule keeps an explicit ignore list for things static analysis cannot see: `pino-pretty` (referenced as a transport string), `tailwindcss` (a Tailwind v4 peer of `@tailwindcss/vite`), the `catalog:mobile` React Native singleton pins, Expo plugin inferences, and `zod` in `@repo/auth`.

  That last one is worth recording: knip reported `zod` as unused in `@repo/auth` and nothing imports it, but removing it breaks the build with TS2742 — better-auth's inferred types reference zod, so it is required for declaration emit. The pre-existing catalog alignment test already guarded it. **Verify a dependency removal with a build, not a grep.**

  Removed genuinely dead code that knip surfaced, each verified unreferenced first: eight source files across api/web/mobile, plus `react-i18next` from `@repo/translation` (declared but imported nowhere in the repo). Deleted `vitest.workspace.ts` — it used `defineWorkspace`, deprecated in the installed Vitest 3.2.4 and removed in 4, was invoked by nothing, and had drifted from `vitest.coverage.config.ts`, which is now the single project list.

  Normalized the four tsconfigs that extended the root base directly instead of the shared presets in `packages/config/typescript/`.

  Five new alignment tests, each verified to fail when violated: every workspace declares `@repo/config`; `globalDependencies` never lists the lockfile or globs a package; neither Dockerfile hand-copies `packages/config`; vitest importers declare vitest; ESLint plugins live in `@repo/config` and not the root.

- 2a37f9d: Generate mobile NativeWind design tokens from packages/ui globals.css and fail when they drift.
- 79fa89e: Complete TypeScript project references for tsc-emitting packages: composite `tsconfig.build.json` + `tsc -b`, while typecheck keeps source paths (issue #147).
