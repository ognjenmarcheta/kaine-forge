A signed-in user now manages their own account on the web app's new `/account` page, opened from the sidebar user menu: avatar and display name, email address, password, signed-in sessions, linked sign-in methods, and account deletion. The avatar uploader moves there from `/security`, which keeps two-step verification only.

`@repo/auth` turns on better-auth `user.changeEmail` (`updateEmailWithoutVerification: false`, so the email changes only after the new address is verified; a verified user's old address approves the change first) and `user.deleteUser` with an emailed confirmation link to `<WEB_APP_URL>/account/delete?token=…`. Deletion is refused with `SOLE_OWNER_OF_SHARED_ORGANIZATION` or `PERSONAL_ORGANIZATION_HAS_MEMBERS`, and the error body carries `organizationName`. In one locked transaction before the user row goes, the Organizations the user is alone in are deleted (their storage is queued for the sweep) and a shared, non-personal Organization's `user_id` moves to another owner. New `GET /account/social-providers` lists the providers the server configured. `AuthTransport` gains `updateProfile`, `changePassword`, `changeEmail`, `listSessions`, `revokeSession`, `revokeOtherSessions`, `listAccounts`, `listSocialProviders`, `linkSocialAccount`, `unlinkAccount`, `requestAccountDeletion` and `confirmAccountDeletion`; `AuthRequestError` gains `organizationName`. Breaking: `/sign-up/email` and `/update-user` refuse `image`, and `/organization/create` and `/organization/update` refuse `logo`, with `PUBLIC_ASSET_URL_READ_ONLY`. Only the API's Public Asset upload writes those URLs, because a client-chosen URL could name another owner's file.

`@repo/db` breaking change: migration `0017` makes `files.uploaded_by` and `organizations.user_id` nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so `File.uploadedBy` and `Organization.userId` are `string | null`. An Attachment stays with its Organization after its uploader deletes their account, and an Organization that reaches a user while their account is being deleted survives with its members. The migration also adds a `public_asset_purges` queue (user id and image URL) that a trigger fills for every deleted user.

`@repo/api`: new avatars and logos are published under `avatars/<userId>/` and `organization-logos/<organizationId>/`. Replacing a Public Asset, purging a deleted Organization's logo, and the new sweep of deleted users' avatars delete an object only when its key belongs to that owner. A legacy key without an owner is left in the bucket.

`@repo/email` adds the `emailChangeApproval` and `accountDeletion` templates (en, sr, de) for these emails.

`@repo/ui`: `NavUser` takes an optional `accountItem` menu entry above log out.
