Add the `@repo/desk` workspace: the shared stage and agent-output contracts, the pure pipeline
transition table, the per-issue state store with a process lease, and the desk configuration
loader for the upcoming local agent desk. Add the GitHub intake path: the `gh` port, owner
authorization, the issue contract reader, `agent:*` execution labels, the status comment, the
worktree bootstrap plan, `desk doctor`, and the `start`, `status`, and `labels sync` commands.
Add the pipeline engine: the stage runner with engine invariants around every agent run, the
scheduler, process leases, and restart recovery.
Add the engine commands (`approve`, `feedback`, `continue`, `cancel`, `remove`, `logs`, `resume`), live progress, a persistent redacted agent log, and a `notifyCommand` that runs without a shell.
Add the ship step: `ship --dry-run` and `ship --confirm` commit, push, and open a draft PR through the repository hooks after a fail-closed gate (confirmation, matching checks and review, owner identity, authorization, refs baseline). The desk never merges. Add the local server (`desk serve`) with a loopback-only, cookie-protected API.
Add the `@repo/desk-ui` workspace: the React desk with a board, an issue page, a React Flow graph of the pipeline, the plan and ship gates with a two-step ship dialog, a live log, and a health view, in English, German, and Serbian. Add the `desk` translation namespace. `pnpm desk serve` builds the UI first when it is missing, and `pnpm desk:ui` starts the Vite dev server with a proxy to a running desk. `@repo/desk` adds the `ship-plan` artifact id and browser-safe views of the check report and the ship plan.
The built desk opens at a plain local URL in each browser and issues its session cookie on page load. The one-use link remains for the separate Vite development origin.
Add optional Docker isolation (`desk start --isolation docker`, `isolation: "docker"`). One `IsolationPort` decides where the builder and the check steps run. In Docker mode they run in hardened containers with no network, a read-only root, no capabilities, and no host mount. Work moves in as a git bundle and a patch and out as a guarded patch, and dependencies come through a registry-only proxy and install offline. Add `desk docker build|login|doctor|status|prune`, `desk doctor --probe` with isolation probes, a per-issue `isolation` state field, a `docker` config block, labelled and verified cleanup in `remove` and crash recovery, and a container-only Codex sandbox flag. Real-Docker tests run with `DESK_DOCKER=1`.
The desk board is a kanban with search, a start dialog, toasts, and compact cards that read only the issue summary (`prUrl`, `contract`, `stageEnteredAt`, `resumeStage`, `progress`, `currentNode`). Log entries carry their time in `at` only. `@repo/ui` also exports the `GitPullRequest`, `Plus`, `Search`, `SlidersHorizontal`, and `X` icons.
