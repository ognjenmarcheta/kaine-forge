Add organization invitation lifecycle: create/list/accept/revoke with role rules, expiry, and email notification. New REST routes under /api/auth/organization/invitation/\* and an invitations GraphQL query. Membership rows are now enforced unique per (organization, user) via a new unique index and migration, and invitation acceptance flips status and inserts the membership atomically.
