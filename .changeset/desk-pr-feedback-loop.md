Send PR feedback back to the builder after ship. At `pr-open`, `pnpm desk feedback <n> --from-pr [text]` (and the `pr-feedback` action, **Send PR feedback** in the UI) reads the failing checks with their log tail and the reviews and comments of trusted accounts on the PR head, redacts, cuts, and fences that text, adds the owner's optional note, and runs build, check, and review again. It refuses with `pr-refused` and changes nothing unless the PR is open, its head is the clean worktree HEAD, and there is something to send. The ship of such a round updates the open PR: no rebase, a plain push to the same branch, no new PR, and a fresh read of the PR right before the push.
